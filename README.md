# Variational Autoencoder for Data Generation (Realistic Data Generation)

- Generated synthetic data with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Designed encoder and decoder networks.
- Used the reparameterization trick for training stability.
- Trained with ELBO and KL-Divergence. Evaluated through data reconstruction and new sample generation.
