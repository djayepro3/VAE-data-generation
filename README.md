- Generated synthetic data with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Designed encoder and decoder networks.
- Used the reparameterization trick (Kingma & Welling) for training stability.
- Trained with ELBO and KL-Divergence. Evaluated through data reconstruction and new sample generation.


## Usage

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/djayepro3/VAE-data-generation
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd VAE-data-generation
    ```
